 # Cafe

 ### Description
 A small program to take a line of text input from the user, convert it into a coffee order, and save it to a file. To view it in action, clone the repo to your own machine, and run ```python3 cafe.py```

 To view a sample GUI version of the program created with Tkinter, run ```python3 gui.py```. The use of the Tkinter windowing system isn't relevant to the 
 course - it's included only as an example in response to a question in a coding coach session!
